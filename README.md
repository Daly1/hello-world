# hello-world
my freecode camp repos
Hi everyone.

Im new to the coding life, I have had all different types of jobs and now since I have been unemployed I found
the free code camp and since everything is becoming technology based and I have always loved computers I figured
it was time to try and learn a new profession instead of working dead end jobs for the rest of my life.
